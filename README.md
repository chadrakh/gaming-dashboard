# Gaming Dashboard
This project is a concept user interface, built with React, based on the popular gaming service 'Steam'. The project is in its *early* stages, as there are quite a few features I'm looking forward to adding - but I wanted to focus on the base interface.

## Running the application
- Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/chadrakh/gaming-dashboard.git`
- Start application `npm run dev`

### Future Improvements
- Add user settings page
- Add dropdowns to filter games by tags, release year, developer, etc.
- Add search functionality to find games
- Build a Games API to populate the dashboard with data
