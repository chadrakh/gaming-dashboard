# React Dashboard UI
This project is a concept user interface, built with React, based on the popular gaming service 'Steam'. The project is in its *early* stages, as there are quite a few features I'm looking forward to adding - but I wanted to focus on the base UI first.

## Running the application
- Clone repo `https://github.com/chadrakh/react-dashboard-ui.git`
- Open in preferred IDE (I used VS Code during development)
- Run `npm install` to download dependencies
- Run `yarn start || npm start || npx start` to start up

In the project directory, you can run:

### Future Improvements
- Mobile view implementation (focus was desktop as the concept in mind was for a desktop app)
- Adding sections to split and describe home screen display
- Implementing more components for reusable pieces such as the gaming grids
- Adding user settings section
- Adding search functionality to filter through games displayed
- Building a custom API to consume to use a pool to randomly generate games, along with their descriptions, prices, etc.

#### - P.S. remember to add the Figma prototype that you made
